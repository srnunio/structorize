# [structorize](https://pub.dev/packages/structorize)

With just a few commands I create all
The structure needed to get your Flutter project ready to run.

## Installation

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  structorize: ^0.0.1+2
```

# Setup

- Note: By running this command some files in your flutter project will be modified. Example: ```main.dart``` and ```pubspec.yaml```. So I do not advise running this command in a project that already has other configurations made

```
flutter pub run structorize:start
```

```
flutter pub get
```

```
flutter pub run gen_i18n:initialize --locale-en-pt
```

```
flutter packages pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

> It is important to run all these commands to ensure that there is no error

This will create the following structure (Domain Driven Design):

## Note

When creating a flutter project I adopted certain patterns of developments, folder structures and others
Settings that help me build applications: testable, scalable, and easy to maintain.

In most of my works the architecture is the same, the design pattern is the same, the management
state is the same and has dependencies that I use almost by default.

In this way I created this library in order to automate my work, with just a few commands I created all
The structure needed to get a Flutter project ready to run.
